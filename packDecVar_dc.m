function [z,pack] = packDecVar_dc(t,x,u)
%
% This function collapses the time (t), state (x)
% and control (u) matricies into a single vector
%
% INPUTS:
%   t = [1, nTime] = time vector (grid points)
%   x = [nState, nTime] = state vector at each grid point
%   u = [nControl, nTime] = control vector at each grid point
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   z = column vector of 2 + nTime*(nState+nControl) decision variables
%   pack = details about how to convert z back into t,x, and u
%       .nTime
%       .nState
%       .nControl
